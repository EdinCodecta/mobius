"""Preloaded app-service processes: run module setup once, fork per request.

A json-v1 request normally starts a fresh interpreter from the accepted app
revision (``app_services._run_spawned``). For a FastAPI service most of the
~0.9 s that costs is importing code, and an app's private requests wait for
each other in one serialized lane, so every queued request adds that second.

An entry that declares ``MOBIUS_PRELOAD = True`` promises that its module-level
setup is request independent: it reads no per-request value (``APP_TOKEN``, the
request) and starts no threads. For such an entry the platform keeps one host
process per (app, runtime revision), ``service_preload_host.py``, which runs the
setup once and forks a child per request. The child receives the request's own
environment and stdio, runs only the entry's ``if __name__ == "__main__":``
block, and exits: each request still gets a fresh process, its own token, a
killable process group, bounded output, and the entry's own error handling.

Preloading is an optimization, never a dependency. A request is served by an
ordinary spawn whenever no ready host exists (the first request after start or
Apply, which also starts the host in the background), the entry has not opted
in, preloading failed, or the host died before forking the request's child.

Lifecycle: a host pins its app's runtime files like any reader, is retired
before Apply/install prunes older runtime trees, after ``IDLE_SECONDS`` without
requests, and when its revision is no longer current. A host that exits on
its own is dropped and not restarted for RETRY_AFTER_FAILURE_SECONDS. Its
control socket's other end lives only in this backend process, so a host exits
by itself when the backend stops or crashes. The host holds no credential; each
child gets a freshly minted token with its request.
