"""Best-effort eviction of file pages left behind by short-lived tools.

Railway accounts a container's page cache in ``memory.current``.  Large
compiler, browser, and provider executables can therefore remain billable
after their processes have exited.  This module uses POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED on
known tool files; it never deletes or rewrites a file. Source-tree sweeps skip
mapped files; exact tool executables may advise unused pages even when shared.
